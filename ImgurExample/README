++ Description ++

This example logs the user into or out of Imgur using OAUTH 1.0a and uses the authenticated Imgur API to allow the user to upload photos to their account.

++ Usage ++

In order to compile this and have it work correctly you need to register a 3rd Party application with Imgur. You then must enter your consumer keys into the code where specified shortly after the imports. At time of writing, the Imgur API is a work in progress so in order to use oauthflow-imgur://callback as your callback URL like I did you will need to e-mail alan@imgur.com for permission.

Additionally, I've only tested this app using the default Android browser. It's possible that some or all versions of alternative browsers such as Opera or Firefox may not work with this application.

++ Why this example is awesome ++

*It uses only a single Activity.
*It works on all Android devices running firmware 1.6 or higher.
*It should serve as a simple yet thorough base for anyone getting started with integrating Imgur with Android as well as anyone looking for an example of successful OAUTH 1.0a authentication on Android.

++ What's coming ... ++

A couple of general fixes need to be applied such as image format detection. I'm considering writing a better UI for the client as long as it doesn't interfere with the simplicitiy of the coding.
