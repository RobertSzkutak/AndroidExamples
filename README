++ Description ++

These Android Examples each demonstrate a concept or a solution to a common problem. I've published them open source under the GPL v3 because I feel they may be useful to other Android developers. If you do something cool with one of them, I think it would be awesome if you told me what it was :)

++ Examples and Brief Description ++

Twitter Example -- This is a simple single Activity Twitter client which uses the Android Web Browser to perform OAUTH authentication and then send a Tweet using the Twitter4J library.

Tumblr Example -- This is a simple single Activity Tumblr client which uses the Android Web Browser to perform OAUTH authentication. Eventually it will do something more than just that.
