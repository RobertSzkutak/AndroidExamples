++ Description ++

These Android Examples each demonstrate a concept or a solution to a common problem. I've published them open source under the GPL v3 because I feel they may be useful to other Android developers. If you do something cool with one of them, I think it would be awesome if you told me what it was :)

++ Examples and Brief Description ++

Drawing Example 1 -- This is a really simple example showing how to draw an image onto an XY coordinate pair on Android

Drawing Example 2 -- This is based off of Drawing Example 1. This simple example shows how to draw at 60FPS using a thread.

Imgur Example -- This is a simple single Activity Imgur client which uses the Android Web Browser to perform OAUTH authentication and uses the authenticated Imgur API to upload photos to the user's account.

RSS Example -- Asynchronously loads an RSS feed. Allows for viewing of single items in the RSS feed. RSS Item viewer contains a simple HTML parser. Uses shared preferences for viewing different RSS feeds.
