++ Description ++

This example logs the user into Tumblr using OAUTH 1.0a. It then allows the user to make a post to their blog.

++ Usage ++

In order to compile this and have it work correctly you need to register a 3rd Party application with Tumblr. You then must enter your consumer keys into the code where specified shortly after the imports. Additionally, your Tumblr application settings must have a callback URL which matches your scheme and parameters defined in your intent filter. I used oauthflow-tumblr://callback for my callback URL.

Additionally, I've only tested this app using the default Android browser. It's possible that some or all versions of alternative browsers such as Opera or Firefox may not work with this application.

++ Why this example is awesome ++

*It uses only a single Activity.
*It demonstrates using HTTP POST to make a Tumblr blog post
*It works on all Android devices running firmware 1.6 or higher.
*It should serve as a simple yet thorough base for anyone getting started with integrating Tumblr with Android as well as anyone looking for an example of successful OAUTH 1.0a authentication on Android.
